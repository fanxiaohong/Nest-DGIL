# Nest-DGIL

This repository contains the natural image CS and sparse-view CT reconstruction pytorch codes for the following paper：  
Xiaohong Fan, Yin Yang, Ke Chen, Yujie Feng, and Jianping Zhang*, “Nest-DGIL: Nesterov-optimized Deep Geometric Incremental Learning for Inverse Problems in CS Image Reconstruction”, 2023.  Under review.

These codes are built on PyTorch and tested on Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 (Python3.x, PyTorch>=0.4) with Intel Xeon CPU E5-2630 and Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU.
